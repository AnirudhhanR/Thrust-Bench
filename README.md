## Usage

### Calibration

1.  **HX711 Calibration:**
    -   Run the `Load_calibration` sketch on Arduino.
    -   Follow serial monitor instructions to calibrate each load sensor.
2.  **ESC Calibration:**
    -   (Optional) Calibrate ESC through the Arduino if necessary, using the provided calibration sketch.

### Running the Program

1.  Open and update the `Thrust Bench Source` file with calibration factors.
2.  Upload the code to Arduino and note the COM port.
3.  Run `main.py` in Python, ensuring the Arduino IDE is closed.

### Functionalities

-   **General Window:** Displays real-time sensor data.
-   **Throttle Control:** Adjust motor RPM via the "Set Throttle" input.
-   **Limits Window:** Set voltage and current limits.
-   **HALT Button:** Emergency shutdown/start.
    -   Pressing "HALT" shuts down the Thrust Bench.
    -   In HALT state, no inputs affect the system, and the motor cannot spin.
    -   The red LED glows in HALT state.
    -   Pressing "HALT" again restarts the system.
-   **Data Collection:** Save sensor data to a CSV file.
    -   Use "Start" to begin data capture.
    -   Use "Stop" to end data capture and save the file.
    -   "Choose Save Location" allows changing the default "Downloads" directory.
-   **Custom Setup:** Upload custom configurations via YAML files (feature to be added).
    -   "Browse" to select a YAML config file.
    -   "Use" to apply the configurations.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Installation Issues:**
    -   Ensure all software dependencies are correctly installed.
    -   Verify hardware connections against the circuit diagram.
-   **Calibration Problems:**
    -   Double-check sensor connections and repeat calibration steps.
-   **Operational Errors:**
    -   Use the HALT functionality for emergency shutdowns.
    -   Consult the serial monitor for error messages during operation.

## Additional Notes

-   The application includes features for monitoring current, voltage, torque, and thrust.
-   Future updates will include graphing functionalities and custom setup options.
